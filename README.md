# Machine Simulator

## Project Overview
Refer to Master branch
This Java project is a simulator for a simple machine with components such as cache, memory, registers, and a CPU. The simulator mimics the basic operations of a computer, allowing users to understand the interactions between different hardware components.

## Features

- **Cache**: Simulates cache memory with different levels and policies.
- **Memory**: Implements main memory to store and retrieve data.
- **Registers**: Provides a set of registers for holding temporary data.
- **CPU**: Simulates a basic CPU that can execute instructions and interact with memory and registers.
- **Instruction Set**: Supports a predefined set of instructions for the CPU to execute.
- **Pipeline**: (Optional) Simulates instruction pipeline stages for advanced CPU operations.
